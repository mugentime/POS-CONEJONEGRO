# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @mugentime will be requested for review when someone 
# opens a pull request.
* @mugentime

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @mugentime and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
